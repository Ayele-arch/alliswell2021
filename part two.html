<h1>
    History
</h1>
<h2>
    Pre-20 Century
</h2>
<p>
    Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting
    device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi 
    (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. 
    The use of counting rods is one <><li>abacus</li>
    <li>Antikythera mechanism</li>
    <li>Planisphere</li>
    <li>Sector</li>
<h2>Antikythera</h2>
<p>was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, 
    many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed 
    n a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.</p>
<h2>Planisphere</h2>
<p>believed to be the earliest mechanical analog computer, according to Derek J. de Solla Price. It was designed to calculate astronomical 
    positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been 
    dated to c. 100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand 
    years later.</p>
<h2>Sector</h2>
<p>calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, 
    such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.</p>

<h1>First computing device</h1>
<p>The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand – this was a major problem for a 
    device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding.

<h1>Analog computers</h1>
<p>The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT
     starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen 
     of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had 
     spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications 
     uch as education (slide rule) and aircraft (control systems)</p>
     <h2>Digital computers</h2>
<p>Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a 
    low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes.</p>
  <h2>Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits</h2>
  <p>Purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital 
      calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to 
      explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five
      years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum 
      tubes. In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff–Berry 
      Computer (ABC) in 1942,the first "automatic electronic digital computer".This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 
      vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory.</p>
    <h1>Modern computers</h1>
    <p>he principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper, On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called 
        "Universal Computing machine" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing 
        anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental 
        concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. Von Neumann acknowledged 
        that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in 
        theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, 
        which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.</p>

    <dd><dt>Transistors</dt><dl>At the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using 
        the newly developed transistors instead of valves. their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by
         1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz 
         clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized 
         computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955,built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research 
         Establishment at Harwell.</dl></dd>
    <dd><dt>Integrated circuits</dt><dl>The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit (IC). 
        The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry 
        of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress 
        in Quality Electronic Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952.</dl></dd>
