<h2>
What does we mean by a Computer?
</h2>
<p>
A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences
of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. It is an electronic device for storing and processing data, 
typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program. Modern computers 
have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable 
computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.

<h3>
    Computer sizes and power
</h3>

    Computers can be generally classified by size and power as follows, though there is considerable overlap:

    Personal computer: A small, single-user computer based on a microprocessor.

    Workstation: A powerful, single-user computer. A workstation is like a personal computer, but it has a more powerful microprocessor and, in general, a higher-quality monitor.

    Minicomputer: A multi-user computer capable of supporting up to hundreds of users simultaneously.

    Mainframe: A powerful multi-user computer capable of supporting many hundreds or thousands of users simultaneously.

    Supercomputer: An extremely fast computer that can perform hundreds of millions of instructions per second.

<h3>
    Supercomputer and Mainframe
</h3>
<p>
Supercomputer is a broad term for one of the fastest computers currently available.
Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for specialized applications that require immense 
amounts of mathematical calculations (number crunching). For example, weather forecasting requires a
supercomputer. Other uses of supercomputers scientific simulations, (animated) graphics,
fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic design, and analysis of geological
data (e.g. in petrochemical prospecting). Perhaps the best known supercomputer manufacturer is Cray
Research.

<h3>
Minicomputer
</h3>
<p>
    It is a midsize computer. In the past decade, the distinction between large minicomputers and 
    small mainframes has blurred, however, as has the distinction between small minicomputers and workstations. But in general, a minicomputer 
    is a multiprocessing system capable of supporting from up to 200 users simultaneously.

<h3>
    Workstation
</h3>
<p>
It is a type of computer used for engineering applications (CAD/CAM), desktop publishing, 
software development, and other types of applications that require a moderate amount of computing power
and relatively high quality graphics capabilities. Workstations generally come with a large,
high-resolution graphics screen, at large amount of RAM, built-in network support, and a graphical user
interface. Most workstations also have a mass storage device such as a disk drive, but a special type
of workstation, called a diskless workstation, comes without a disk drive. The most common operating 
systems for workstations are UNIX and Windows NT. Like personal computers, most workstations are single-user 
computers. However, workstations are typically linked together to form a local-area network, although they 
can also be used as stand-alone systems.
