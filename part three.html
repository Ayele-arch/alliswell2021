<h1>Input devices</h1>
<p>An input device is any hardware equipment used to send data to computers thereby facilitating us 
    to interact with it. It has the capability of converting the raw data into the format or language
    which is computer-readable and finally delivers the translated data to the Central Processing Unit 
    (CPU) for further processing. The best examples of computer input devices are: Keyboard, Mouse, Joy Stick, 
    Light pen, Graphic Tablet, Touch screen, Microphone, Scanner, Magnetic Ink Character Reader 
    (MICR), Optical Character Reader (OCR), Bar Code Reader, and Webcam.</p>
<h2>Output Devices</h2>
<p>An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment which converts information into 
    human-readable form. It can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, and video. Some of the output 
    devices are Visual Display Units (VDU) i.e. a Monitor, Printer, Graphic Output devices, Plotters, 
    speakers etc. The best examples of output devices are; Monitor, Printer, Headphones, Computer Speakers,
     Projector, GPS, Sound Card and Video Card.</p>

<dd><dt>Processing</dt><dl>Processing devices are the components responsible for the processing of 
    information within the computer system. This includes devices such as the CPU, memory and 
    motherboard. Storage devices are components which allow data to be stored within a computer 
    system. Examples of processing units are; Central processing unit (CPU) Graphics processing unit 
    (GPU) Motherboard. Network card. Sound card.</dl></dd>

<p>The control unit fetches data and instructions from memory and uses operations of the ALU to carry 
    out those instructions using that data. (The control unit and ALU together are referred to as the 
    entral processing unit [CPU]).</p>
<h3>Social, economic, political and environmental.</h3>
<dd><dt>Storage</dt><dl>Storage is a key component of digital devices, as consumers and businesses have come 
    to rely on it to preserve information ranging from personal photos to business-critical information. 
    Storage is frequently used to describe the devices and data connected to the computer through input/output 
    (I/O) operations, including hard disks, flash devices, tape systems and other media types.</dl></dd>
<dd><dt>Internet</dt><dl>Internet is a global computer network providing a variety of information and 
    communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication 
    protocols. It is a global wide area network that connects computer systems across the world. It includes 
    several high-bandwidth data lines that comprise the Internet "backbone." These lines are connected to
    major Internet hubs that distribute data to other locations, such as web servers and ISPs.</dl></dd>
